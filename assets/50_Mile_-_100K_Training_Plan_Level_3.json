I'll have you run a variety of types of race-specific workouts, some double runs, some back to back long runs and I'll even have you do some of my tried and true race-prep fast finish long runs. The end result is that you'll be ready physically and mentally to tackle the race.\r\n\r\nPrehab: \r\nYour McMillan training plan doesn't just give you your run training but I'm also including my \"Prehab\" training - non-running training designed to build an injury-resistant body.

I'll walk you through the routine and over time, I'll advance the challenge so you get stronger and stronger.","location_name":null,"location_street":null,"location_city":null,"location_state":null,"location_zip":null,"location_country":null,"is_race":false,"race_place_overall":null,"race_age_group":null,"felt":null,"effort":null,"post_workout_notes":null,"weather_temperature":null,"weather_is_celsius":null,"weather_humidity":null,"weather_sunny":null,"weather_partly_sunny":null,"weather_cloudy":null,"weather_lightrain":null,"weather_rain":null,"weather_snow":null,"weather_windy":null,"CommentCount":0,"CommentCountNew":null,"workout_completion":0,"workout_status_text":null,"workout_status_color":"94AAB8","workout_status_indicator":1,"MapURL":null,"Activities":[{"activity_type_key":"00000001-0001-0001-0001-000000000001","activity_type_name":"Run","activity_type_icon":1,"activity_sub_type_key":null,"activity_sub_type_name":null,"activity_type_color":"#8c8c8c","activity_type_forecolor":"#ffffff","equipment":null,"route":null,"number":1,"planned_duration":null,"planned_amount":null,"planned_amount_type":null,"planned_amount_normalized":null,"planned_pace_low":493.0000,"planned_pace_low_type":"mi","planned_pace_high":433.0000,"planned_pace_high_type":"mi","planned_pace_display":"4:29-5:06","planned_pace_display_type":"min/km","quantity":null,"duration":null,"time_elapsed":null,"time_timer":null,"time_moving":null,"amount":null,"amount_type":null,"amount_normalized":null,"pace":null,"pace_type":null,"pace_display":null,"pace_display_type":null,"speed_avg":null,"speed_max":null,"speed_type":null,"temp_avg":null,"temp_max":null,"power_avg":null,"power_max":null,"cadence_avg":null,"cadence_max":null,"hr_avg":null,"hr_max":null,"rpm_avg":null,"rpm_max":null,"elevation_gain_display_type":null,"elevation_gain_display":null,"elevation_loss_display_type":null,"elevation_loss_display":null,"elevation_gain":null,"elevation_gain_type":null,"elevation_loss":null,"elevation_loss_type":null,"calories":null,"variability":null,"intensity":null,"weighted_power":null,"meanmax_power_30":null,"vertical_oscillation_avg":null,"vertical_oscillation_max":null,"ground_contact_time_avg":null,"ground_contact_time_max":null,"ground_contact_balance_avg":null,"ground_contact_balance_max":null,"stride_length_avg":null,"vertical_ratio_avg":null,"form_power":null,"leg_spring":null,"right_power_avg":null,"right_power_pct_avg":null,"left_power_avg":null,"left_power_pct_avg":null,"RestActivity":null,"Laps":null}],"warm_up":null,"cool_down":null,"plan_instance_info":{"plan_instance_key":"fca63637-47ce-411c-936f-e2e5fae81b00","plan_name":"50 Mile - 100K Training Plan Level 3","target_date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00","number_of_weeks":16,"plan_options":"{\"raceDistance\":\"1/2 Marathon\",\"raceDuration\":\"01:28:30\",\"goalDistance\":\"50 Miles\",\"goalDuration\":\"08:00:00\"}"},"integration_info":null},{"has_download_file":false,"download_file_extension":null,"garmin_sync_time":null,"garmin_sync_available":false,"external_data_source":null,"is_team_workout":false,"can_split":false,"valid_merge_target":true,"valid_merge_source":false,"has_pain_point_records":false,"has_structured_workout":true,"pain_point_records":null,"gender":null,"user_key":"5e2dd0b3-b132-4c37-a655-e0355a82705e","user_name":"Stefanos Chrs","user_profile_pic_url":null,"key":"268344c7-c1cb-4571-8964-730724ebb6fc","wcal_key":null,"wcal_label":null,"can_delete":true,"can_hide":false,"can_move":true,"coach_assigned":false,"coach_user_key":null,"coach_name":null,"coach_profile_pic_url":null,"has_actual_data":true,"has_intervals":false,"has_map":false,"has_stats":false,"has_attachments":false,"attachments":null,"workout_date":"2022-03-08T00:00:00","workout_time":null,"order":0,"plan_day":2,"name":"Easy Run","description":"Run #1: 45-60 minute Easy Run \n\nWorkout Purpose: \nTo build fitness safely, you can use your breathing as your guide to how fast you should be running. On easy runs, you should never get out of breath and should be able to carry on a conversation with a training partner. If you get out of your breath, then you are running too fast.\n\nCoach Notes: \nThe next 3 days are key days in the training plan. You'll do a solid aerobic-building run today, a longer and more fitness-building workout tomorrow then another solid aerobic-building workout the next day. The goal is to give you a big mid-week stimulus then recover for a day then hit the most race-specific workouts - your weekly long runs. This will be the pattern throughout the plan.\n\nPrehab: \nI want you to start your prehab training with the Strength in Stride program. This prehab program is designed to flow with your training plan. You'll start with a stability phase then move to the strength phase and finally to the power phase.

Over time, your body will become accustomed to running on tired legs and this will help you in the race. NOTE: These early long runs are good runs to reduce your carbohydrate intake so you focus more on fat burning. See the Learn section on my website for information on low/no carb training. This is for experienced runners ONLY. So, if this is your first ultra, then fuel for all runs but if you are experienced, then the first few long runs can be done on low carbs.\n\nCoach Notes:\nTime on your feet is more important than pace in a long, steady run. Run easy and run long. Here is a video I made to help understand the Long Run: https://run.mcmillanrunning.com/how-to-long-runs/\n\nPrehab:\nI find that the key to prehab is routine.
